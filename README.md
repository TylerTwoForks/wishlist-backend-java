# WishList

This project was born out of discussions with our large family. <br> 
Having 20ish people in our immediately family, purchasing Christmas gifts for everyone quickly become <br>
extreme. We moved to a randomized approach where you pulled 2 names from a hat.

You buy gifts for those 2 people and you're good to go. 

But what do they want?  <br>
We used to use paper lists.  <br>Then moved onto emails. <br>Eventually ending with Amazon lists that we share with each other.

But what if we don't want to perpetuate the Amazon machine? <br>
What if we want to focus on local businesses? <br>
What if we wanted the "draw 2 names out of a hat" implemented in the same platform? 

We can't do all of that on Amazon.
